      "text": "Born in Carboneras, my relationship with photography was born among the volcanic rocks of Cabo de Gata and the deep blue of the Mediterranean. This arid land, where the desert embraces the sea, taught me to see beauty in the essential, in the light that transforms the landscape at every hour of the day.\n\nBut my camera doesn't stay still. In every journey, in every corner of the world I explore, I seek those fleeting moments that tell stories: a face, a gaze, the light of a sunset on an unknown street. I carry with me the vision I learned here, in my homeland, and apply it to every person and place I encounter.\n\nPhotography is my way of connecting with the world, of capturing the essence of places and the souls that inhabit them."
